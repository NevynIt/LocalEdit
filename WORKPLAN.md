# Editor Workbench Workplan

## Current Status

Implementation completed for the v1 shell and plugin infrastructure. Static verification passed on 2026-05-14. Edge was later confirmed on Machine PATH after refreshing the current process PATH.

## Phase Checklist

- [x] Phase 1: Create this tracker and scaffold `editor-workbench/`.
- [x] Phase 2: Add root HTML files, extension manifest, service worker, bootstraps, and local CSS.
- [x] Phase 3: Implement the app shell and textarea-backed `EditorCore`.
- [x] Phase 4: Add IndexedDB storage, autosave restore, language persistence, file open, and source download.
- [x] Phase 5: Implement plugin contracts, registry, loader, manager, known plugin storage, and plugin manager UI.
- [x] Phase 6: Implement diagnostics, transform, render session, render shell, and export infrastructure.
- [x] Phase 7: Verify browser-mode acceptance criteria manually.

## Verification Log

- [x] Project file structure created under `editor-workbench/`.
- [x] `manifest.json` parses as valid JSON.
- [x] All JavaScript files pass `node --check`.
- [x] Static source scan found no forbidden network or dynamic-code APIs under `editor-workbench/`.
- [x] HTML scan found no inline scripts, inline event handlers, or `javascript:` URLs.
- [x] Core smoke test passed for plugin path validation, document model loading, language registry loading, and plugin registry provider lookup.
- [x] Edge headless opened `file:///C:/Stuff/LocalEdit/editor-workbench/index.html` and exposed the page through DevTools.
- [x] Manual local interaction test pending: type text, open a local file, download source, reload for autosave, and open plugin manager.
- [ ] Manual extension test pending: load `editor-workbench/` as an unpacked Edge/Chrome extension.

## Implementation Notes

- Project package: `editor-workbench/`
- Local entry: `editor-workbench/index.html`
- Extension entry: `editor-workbench/editor.html`
- Runtime style: plain local HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Editor v1: textarea wrapped by `EditorCore`, keeping the editor abstraction ready for CodeMirror later.
- Plugin scope: infrastructure only. No concrete Markdown, Mermaid, JSON, YAML, renderer, or exporter plugin is included.
